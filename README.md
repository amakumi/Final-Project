# Intro To Programming Project
## PitchChecker 

Simply speaking, this program is meant to record the userâ€™s voice to capture its lowest 
vocal pitch and its highest vocal pitch, then records it afterwards. It uses an input device to 
record the incoming voice and what makes it unique is the fact that it uses Pygame module 
to function; one fact which is not frequently seen on other stereotype projects. Furthermore, 
everyone has its own vocal range, thus every result would be heterogenous according their 
own voice. 

If you are not the type to check vocal range, this program can also be used to tune guitars.
